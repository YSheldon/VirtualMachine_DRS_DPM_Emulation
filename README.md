VirtualMachine_DRS_DPM_Emulation
================================

Virtualization Project using VMWare ESXI API

The goal of this project is:
1. Practice with virtualized environment, managing, load balancing and testing VM.
2. Apply open source tools like Logstash or Scribe
3. Understanding the need of gathering and analyze for large data
4. Visualize the collected data

As a part of the project, Developed a simple application that emulate DRS and DPM function, and large-scale statistics gathering and analysis in scalable virtualized environments. Specific areas of interest include health models for multi-tier applications, VM and host performance, and detection of anomalies.
